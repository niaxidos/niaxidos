# Hi, I'm Antonia! ðŸ‘‹

Welcome to my GitHub! I'm a second-year Computer Science student attending Dalhousie University with a passion for software development and problem-solving. Iâ€™m always looking to take on new challenges and grow my skills. I am seeking Summer 2025 Co-op opportunities.

### What I Work On:
- **Languages I Use:** Java, HTML/CSS, JavaScript, Python, C\#, SQL
- **Projects:** I love working on real-world projects. Some of my recent work includes [ConQuest](https://github.com/niaxidos/shiftkey-mental-2025), a speech-to-speech AI built to help people manage and reduce social anxiety. This was a team project where I contributed to the AI response system and front-end design.
  
Iâ€™d love to collaborate with others on exciting tech projects â€” feel free to reach out!
